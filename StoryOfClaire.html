<h1 class="title"> Story of Claire </h1>
				<p>
				Claire grew up as a kid in an environment that was dire and without much greenery - A place almost seemingly like a wasteland. 
				As she grew older and matures more, 
				she took up voluntarily roles that were contributive to conserving nature and its beautiful greenery.
				</p>
				<p>
				When she completed and graduated from secondary schooling, 
				she never knew a wide range of opportunities were waiting for her which would allow her to share her passion of saving the environment with many others.
				After a long period of resting holidays, opens Tertiary school life; Claire's next step to raising environmental awareness.
				</p>
				<p>
				Tertiary lifestyle proved to be very different from the all the schoolings she had before - where she felt that 
				she was able to more freely act without having much restrictions. 
				Of course, the most important activity she was able to finally carry out was to influence more people to contribute to the environment.\
				</p>
				<p>
				The first thing she did in her new schooling life, at Nanyang Polytechnic, was to find out any organisations / Co-curricular Activities ( CCAs )
				that are related to being able to contribute to nature itself. 
				It is incredibly hard to act by herself.
				</p>
				<p>
				But fortunately she found a place where she could
				commit and give her all, share her ideals, and envelope her passion and herself in her new CCA - the Nanyang Polytechnic Community Club.
				Together with like-minded individuals who desires to do more for nature, Claire aspires to become someone who motivate others to start <br>
				cultivating habits that would do good for the environment. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
				And we, at GreenFuture are a group of people who are influenced by Claire, and would like to do whatever we can to help her out in her glorious mission. 
				However, to actually turn it into a successful organisation, we will definitely need you and your help, to participate in such activities, to turn this world better, and to build a green future!
				Every small help matters!
